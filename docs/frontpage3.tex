  Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be
  identified in this document in order to describe an experimental
  procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended
  to imply recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended
  to imply that the entities, materials, or equipment are necessarily
  the best available for the purpose.

  There may be references in this publication to other publications
  currently under development by NIST in accordance with its assigned
  statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication,
  including concepts and methodologies, may be used by federal
  agencies even before the completion of such companion
  publications. Thus, until each publication is completed, current
  requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain
  operative. For planning and transition purposes, federal agencies
  may wish to closely follow the development of these new publications
  by NIST.
